# HackMit
This is the code my team and I created for social good for the Hackathon HackMit 2019! 


Inspiration We were inspired that all the hackers here wanted to do good in their community and actually create for good.

What it does : Our app promotes social good by motivating random acts of Kindness!

How I built it: We did basic Swift programming and focused more on frontend and little of the bit of backend development.

Challenges I ran into: Using multiple view controllers

Accomplishments that I'm proud of: An app that works without bugs!

What I learned: That I need to learn more about backend development and other APIs
